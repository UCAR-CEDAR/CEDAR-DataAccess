Minor bug fixes. Code brought up to libdap 3.10.x and bes 3.8.x.

News for version 2.1.1, 16 April 2008

This is the first official release of the Cedar++ software. Although the
software has been in use on the cedarweb.hao.ucar.edu web site, we have not
yet had a release of the Cedar++ library.

We have recently changed from using a parameter codes header file and an
instrument KINST header file and instead are accessing information about
parameters and instruments from the CEDARCATALOG database. Database access
is done in the cedar_handler OPeNDAP module code and not in this library.
