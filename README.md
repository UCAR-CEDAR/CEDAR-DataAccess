# CEDAR-DataAccess
CEDAR library that can read CEDAR CBF files

This library allow users to read data from files which follow the CEDAR standards to encode data. This is a read only API since it is not possible to create and/or modify CEDAR files with this library.

Typically files in CEDAR format have the extension 'cbf'. Each file consist of a series of blocks and each block contain one or more records of data. For extra information please refer to the CedarIntroduction.pdf document provided with this release.

Please refer to the INSTALL file on instructions for building and testing
the Cedar++ library.
